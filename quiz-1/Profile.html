        <h3>Hello readers, my name is <span style="color: #004aad;">Ihsan Adhika Rahadian</span>. I'm currently a working <span style="color: #004aad;">data analyst</span> in a major technology company in Australia. I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia. I graduated from an islamic school called Al-Izhar Pondok Labu. I continued my life chapter to <span style="color: #004aad;">ITS</span> and study <span style="color: #004aad;">informatics engineering</span> and took the double degree program to the <span style="color: #004aad;">University of Queensland</span>. After graduated there, I proceeded life by working and live in Australia for now. My hobbies are exercising and listening to music. I am known to be diligent, able to work together, able to communicate, and always ready to help. But I also have flaws which are lack of creativity and confidence. I always try overcome the lack of creativity by brainstorming and mind mapping towards the creative mind. And I overcome the lack of confidence by build positive relationships and be kind to myself.</h3>
